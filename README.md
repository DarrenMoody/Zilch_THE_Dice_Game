# Zilch_THE_Dice_Game
C# Windows Forms Gui App; Roll dice for points. Take a gamble for more points. Just make sure you ROLL BIG!

This will be an interactive dice game via a Windows Forms Application written in C#. I used to play this game 
as a kid and have always wanted to make it into a interactive PC App. I may port this to the Windows 8 Store, 
and perhaps to some other mobile platforms so I am asserting a Copyright Â© on the layout design, and on all code 
that has been and will be written in the design and development of this project. Darren Nelson Moody.
